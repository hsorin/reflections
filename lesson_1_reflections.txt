How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    View the diff actualy direct you to location on the code where the bug occure.
    Some times there can be several diff locations but still it save you from searching on all the code.
    Still on many cases you can guess the location of the bug just but some logic assumptions. In that case you don't need to use diff.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It's clear. When ever you encount a bug that doesn't occur before you can easly search previous version to find what change cause the bug.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually commit is a logic option since you know when changes are made and you thing it's a good idea to save. If you are not a responsable person and you don't have systematic work habit better don't count on it. Automatically saved are good only when you are doing on intesive work on the program.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is more dedicated to programs files while GD to documents that ussually are not related.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log show all the saved files history and then you can select wichh saved ver you want to check.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Much more confident

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Just study for now
